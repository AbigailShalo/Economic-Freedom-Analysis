# Economic Freedom Analysis 
This project focuses on analysing the Economic Freedom Dataset provided by The Heritage Foundation. Economic freedom is the fundamental right of every human to control his or her own labor and property. We measure economic freedom based on 12 quantitative and qualitative factors. Each factor is measured with equal score.
